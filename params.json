{"name":"Resume","tagline":"a hard core dev keeps his resume on github","body":"## Profile\r\nI solve problems. I define solutions that are driven from a deep understanding of my client’s business and then educate them about how we’re going to help; I take this same understanding and then parse it out into fine-grained tasks that a production team can execute. I’m always willing (and excited) to step up and code, injecting business acumen right into the bits that make the magic happen. I’m a technologist who flexes leadership qualities and consulting prowess to motivate clients and team members towards meeting ambitious project scopes and timelines.\r\n\r\n####[Download Resume](https://github.com/patrickprandt/resume/raw/master/Patrick_Brandt.pdf)\r\n####Connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/wpatrickbrandt)\r\n\r\n##Skills + Experience\r\n* Domain-Driven Design\r\n* Test-Driven Development\r\n* Continuous Integration\r\n* Scalable Architecture\r\n* Agile\r\n* PERT estimation\r\n* Amazon Web Services\r\n* Microsoft Azure\r\n* Google App Engine\r\n* Fluent NHibernate\r\n* ASP .Net MVC\r\n* C#\r\n* F#\r\n* SQL Server\r\n* MySql\r\n* Log4net\r\n* Backbone.js\r\n* Require.js\r\n* Underscore.js\r\n* node.js/socket.io\r\n* Open Graph API\r\n* Git\r\n* SVN\r\n* NUnit\r\n* Moq\r\n* HTML/CSS\r\n* jQuery\r\n* JSON\r\n* XML/XSL/XPath\r\n* Python/Django\r\n* PHP/CodeIngiter\r\n* Objective-C/iOS\r\n* OpenNI/NITE (for Microsoft Kinect)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
